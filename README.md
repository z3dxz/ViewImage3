# View Image 3
This is the upcoming rewrite of the **cosine64.com** image viewer  

# The Real Deal

The old viewer's code was extremely hard to read and was a mess. This code is going to be properly object-oriented with the necessary abstraction to ensure optimal stability  

## Why?

- This image viewer is going to be hardware-accelerated, support high-dpi, and be cross-platform  
- The old viewer was completely software rendered, had no high-dpi support, and only worked on Windows.  

## How

- The old viewer was written using the **Win32 API** which was painful and slow, as well as being exclusive to windows  
- This new image viewer is going to be written mostly in **SFML or OpenGL (haven't decided yet)** and it will be cross-platform, hardware accelerated, and produce cleaner code

# Compatibility

- Compatibility will become slightly more strict, however.  
- Windows XP will be very difficult to support so it is undecided whether or not it is going to be supported  
- Linux shall be 100% be supported  
- Some older computers may run the software faster due to it's increased optimization  

# Compilation

Dependencies:
- CMake
- Standard C++
- SFML
